Well I suffer for this rapid fire writing and often find myself unable to read my own writing afterwards, so when I come across old writing like this I edit it slightly myself to make it easier to follow.\n\nIn fact if you find issues in the writing, reach out, in a kind way.",

Shortly afterwards realised that one of them was such, a little subby bitch, so got some ribbon and slip rings, tried my hand at sewing and made it a bondage harness. The harness design is not practical but it's kind of hard to work it around it's sitting pose well. There is numerous sewing mistakes and a single math mistake.\nMake foamboard inserts for my board game boxes so they better hold all their pieces, like:\n\nFor Carcassonne, since I have around twice as many pieces as the base game has thanks to some neat expansions.\n\nIn the future, Betrayal at House on The Hill, which doesn't transport well and also, expansion.\n\nSea shanties, like the longest Johns\n\nThings that I keep forgetting are really fun\n\nOrganizing my clothes\nLike the drawer under my bed was a mess, so I got some IKEAüéâ fabric box things designed for it, and then I just folded up clothes up, I tried rolling but it wasn't as good, and put them in and now I have neat little cubes of jammies, so many non-pairs of jammies.\nAs a downside I learned that my cat has shed so much hair in this under bed drawer.\n\nPrevious Hyper fixations\n\nCooking, I tried it for a bit but my girlfriend is fussy when it comes to eating, and it was annoying to buy the things I needed so I just reverted back into eating pasta, though I did learn to put garlic in things and mix up Chorizo seasoning.\n\nCurrent random math stim\n\naboutÀêcurrent-random-math-stim\n\nI often have a random math idea going through my mind that I will just blurt out randomly and it goes nowhere but it's fun. It's lead to some crazy fun stuff in the past.\n\nInverted sqrts.\nLike I know about sqrts, I know I can estimate them by like, finding the nearest square number, we shall call that b2 and then combining b with the difference of the number in question with the nearest square (b2 don't forget) and dividing that by 2b\nIn formula terms that looks like this: $$a^2 \\approx \\left(b+\\frac{a^2-b^2}{2b}\\right)^2$$\nI can tell you have doubts but if you just expand it out\na2‚âàb2+2b‚ãÖa2‚àíb22b+(a2‚àíb22b)2And of course the 2bs cancel then the b2s cancel and finally we get\na2‚âàa2+(a2‚àíb22b)2And boom the estimate is only off by that tiny amount!
