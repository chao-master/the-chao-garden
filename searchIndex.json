		"content": "roll a d20 once and get a 1.\nIs it weighted? Probably not, it could still be totally fair,\nit's a 5% chance, and getting a bad 5% chance once is totally normal\nSo we accept that\nNow we take a coin, it's weighted, but how weighted?\nWe flip it 12 times, and get 0 heads.\nIs it weighted to always be tails? Maybe.\nBut what if there was 20 parallel universes,\nand we just happen to be in the 1 that got all tails?\nThat's a 5% chance, the same as our non suspicious d20,\nso lets say if an event happens 5% of the time, then us observing it isn't once isn't weird or abnormal, even if it is unlucky\nWe can then calculate how likely tails has to be so that 12 tails has a 5% chance, which gives us how unlikely tails could be and we still have at least a 5% chance of getting 12.\nThe chance of getting 12 tails in a row is p12, where p is the chance of 1 tails\nIf we solve this for a probability of 5% we get p=0.0512 which is ‚âà78%\nWhich is far off what a na√Øve guess of just looking at how many tails appeared would give us (Which would be 100%). We hence say that the actual chance the coin gives tails is [78%,100%] (With a 95% confidence)\nThis is just a rough overview, in reality a more complicated formula know as the Wilson Score interval is used to give a more accurate answer, but this shows how a na√Øve guess of &quot;it is always tails&quot; is wrong.\nIf we were continue to flip the coin and always see tails then the lower 78% bound on our estimate would rise, with 24 trails we get 88%. 48 trails gives 93%, doubling the number of trails roughly halves the distance to 100%",

Shortly afterwards realised that one of them was such, a little subby bitch, so got some ribbon and slip rings, tried my hand at sewing and made it a bondage harness. The harness design is not practical but it's kind of hard to work it around it's sitting pose well.

It's lead to some crazy fun stuff in the past.\n\nInverted sqrts.\nLike I know about sqrts, I know I can estimate them by like, finding the nearest square number, we shall call that b2 and then combining b with the difference of the number in question with the nearest square (b2 don't forget) and dividing that by 2b\nIn formula terms that looks like this: $$a^2 \\approx \\left(b+\\frac{a^2-b^2}{2b}\\right)^2$$\nI can tell you have doubts but if you just expand it out\na2‚âàb2+2b‚ãÖa2‚àíb22b+(a2‚àíb22b)2And of course the 2bs cancel then the b2s cancel and finally we get\na2‚âàa2+(a2‚àíb22b)2And boom the estimate is only off by that tiny amount!
