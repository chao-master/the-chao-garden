- Current hyper fixations
	- Arts and crafts, specifically:
		- Putting a Glaceon plush into a bondage harness made out of ribbon. Like I'm really fucking proud of this, its going to be a gift, look at it (No idea what it's pronouns are yet)

		  And of course, there is a DOM! ![_attachments/20241202_223629.jpg|600](/img/user/_attachments/20241202_223629.jpg)
		  I got them both from the GAME in the House of Fraser as it closed, and since it was closing I got them both for a killer price. Shortly afterwards realised that one of them was such, a little subby bitch, so got  some ribbon and slip rings, tried my hand at sewing and made it a bondage harness. The harness design is not practical but it's kind of hard to work it around it's sitting pose well. There is numerous sewing mistakes and a single math mistake. 
		- Make foamboard inserts for my board game boxes so they better hold all their pieces, like:
			- For Carcassonne, since I have around twice as many pieces as the base game has thanks to some neat expansions.

			- In the future, Betrayal at House on The Hill, which doesn't transport well and also, expansion.
	- Sea shanties, like the longest Johns

- Things that I keep forgetting are really fun
	- Organizing my clothes
	  Like the drawer under my bed was a mess, so I got some IKEAüéâ fabric box things designed for it, and then I just folded up clothes up, I tried rolling but it wasn't as good, and put them in and now I have neat little cubes of jammies, so many non-pairs of jammies.
	  As a downside I learned that my cat has shed so much hair in this under bed drawer.

- Previous Hyper fixations
	- Cooking, I tried it for a bit but my girlfriend is fussy when it comes to eating, and it was annoying to buy the things I needed so I just reverted back into eating pasta, though I did learn to put garlic in things and mix up Chorizo seasoning.

		- I often have a random math idea going through my mind that I will just blurt out randomly and it goes nowhere but it's fun. It's lead to some crazy fun stuff in the past.
	- Inverted <abbr title="square roots">sqrts</abbr>.
	  Like I know about sqrts, I know I can estimate them by like, finding the nearest square number, we shall call that $b^2$ and then combining $b$ with the difference of the number in question with the nearest square ($b^2$ don't forget) and dividing that by $2b$
	  In formula terms that looks like this: $$a^2 \approx \left(b+\frac{a^2-b^2}{2b}\right)^2$$
	  I can tell you have doubts but if you just expand it out
	  $$a^2 \approx b^2 + 2b\cdot\frac{a^2-b^2}{2b}+\left(\frac{a^2-b^2}{2b}\right)^2$$
	  And of course the $2b$s cancel then the $b^2$s cancel and finally we get
	  $$a^2 \approx a^2+\left(\frac{a^2-b^2}{2b}\right)^2$$
	  And boom the estimate is only off by that tiny amount! Fuck I love maths.
	  Oops I forgot about the inverted sqrts.
	  
	  So...
	  $$A = a^2 \approx \left(b+\frac{a^2-b^2}{2b}\right)^2$$
	  $$\sqrt{A} \approx \left(b+\frac{A-b^2}{2b}\right)$$
	  $$ \therefore \frac{1}{\sqrt{A}} \approx \frac{2b}{2b^2+A-b^2} $$
	  Wait I never knew that it simplified to $\frac{b^2-a^2}{2b}$ I can't tell if that's cooler or not, anyway
	  $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \approx \frac{2b}{b^2+x} $$
