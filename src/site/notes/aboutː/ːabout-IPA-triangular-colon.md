A collection of various length, open format, musing from me about things that I want to write down and maybe one day share.
The name derives from "about:..." pages that web browser have, and I have used the prefix in the past for titling things, such as a previous "about:Operator" page.

The IPA-triangular-colon is explained in [[aboutː/ːIPA-triangular-colon\|aboutː/ːIPA-triangular-colon]].

The urge to write everything down comes from the coinciding of two events, one my manager proposing a "getting to know me" thing, and two encountering hecko, who has a website of similar ramblings.

- Updates:
  The *aboutː* pages will receive updates in 3 main ways:
   - Additions & New pages, whenever I feel the need or urge to write things down I'll add either a new page or a new section to a page as needed
   - Changes, as information becomes out of date or corrections are needed then I'll be modifying large swathes of the data to update and correct it
   - Patches, Often I write these fast without thinking, much to the dismay of my GCSE English teacher who would also say "never think and write at the same time". Well I suffer for this rapid fire writing and often find myself unable to read my own writing afterwards, so when I come across old writing like this I edit it slightly myself to make it easier to follow.
- In fact if you find issues in the writing, reach out, in a kind way.
