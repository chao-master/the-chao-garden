Ah pronouns, in a technical sense they are nothing more than the part of speech that substitutes for nouns or noun phrases which have been previously stated or are understood from the context.
Of course in today's "woke media" they are an *amazing* litmus test (If you want to easily identify if someone is an asshat online, ask them for their pronouns).

Now, onto my pronouns:
> They/Them

Okay we are done right, well you may be here due to a footnote asking you to see aboutːpronouns, so in which case it's propably because you've seen me use a gendered term or different pronoun. Firstly, pronouns, gender, and gendered terms are all different, and using gendered words to describe myself does not in fact invalidate my pronouns.
But secondly, and more importantly, I have a permit.

In the next panel the ranger shows the paper back to him captioned &quot;This just says, &quotI can do what I want.&quot;&quot;](/img/user/_attachments/RonCanDoWhatHeWants.jpg)

The best part about this quote though, which is normally missed in the memes, is the response
> I am the director of the parks department and this is a park

So, if you are concerned, confused, or angry at me telling you all to use they/them and gender neutral terms even though I don't:

> Not to worry. I have a permit
> This just says, "I can use whatever terms I want to describe myself"
> I am the directory of my body & mind and this is my body & mind

On a more precise note, I am gender fluid, and as such depending on a magnitude of factors, including (but not limited to) mood, time, company, and phrasing, different words can have different effect on me, and as such it's just easier to request you all use they/them and neutral terminology.
