Trace, stylised `trace`, is the designation for the separated operator process responsible for providing explicit additional context that other members of the system have not provided for some reason.
While `trace` started existing as an Operator responsibility, they have become their own entity for a few reasons:
 - `trace` has far more of a personality that Operator does. One of Operator's operational requirements is to maintain neutrality as much as possible, but `trace` threatened this with a lot of snark.
 - Operator has an inversion to the pronoun "I", and `trace` does not.

`trace` was originally going to be an acronym, or more over attempts where made to name `trace` with one. It sort of failed but some of the words that where thrown around included `Additional Context` and `Explination`. In the end `trace` felt like a good fit even if it couldn't be made to mean anything weird.
