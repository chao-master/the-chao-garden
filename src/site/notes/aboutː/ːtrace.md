Trace, stylised `trace`, is the designation for the separated operator process responsible for providing explicit additional context that other members of the system have not provided for some reason.
While `trace` started existing as an Operator responsibility, they have become their own entity for a few reasons:
 - `trace` has far more of a personality that Operator does. One of Operator's operational requirements is to maintain neutrality as much as possible, but `trace` threatened this with a lot of snark.
 - Operator has an inversion to the pronoun "I", and `trace` does not.
