Operator has a custom modified pager emoji, based on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update emoji, with two differences. First the emoji is rotated by an angle, and second it says OPERATOR on it, in brail.

The emoji exists on our discord server, and is used to prefix Operator's messages where necessary. On other platforms the pager emoji is used.
