How critical work is is based on two distinct factors:
- The deadline for the work (how long until it has to be done)
- How many people can complete it
By assessing these two different things items are prioritised

Here is a rough[^1] matrix of how items are prioritised[^2]

|                    | Today | This week | This month |
| ------------------ | ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Only you**       | 7     | 5         | 3          |
| **Only your team** | 6     | 4         | 2          |
| **Anyone**         | 3     | 1         | 0          |

7 is highest priority, down to 0 which is such low priority it comes below procrastination.
