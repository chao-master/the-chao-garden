- I use ✨ for a specific type of emphis, best described by me wriggling or opening my fingers while moving them outwards in a slight downward arc like a rainbow
- ✨ is also use internally know as the "Feature emoji" due to it's designation in gitmoji
- ✨ is also regarded as "Oh fuck gosh darn, no, that's a bloody AI button isn't it". The sparkle emoji committee really needs to attack big AI for that.
	- Fun fact, you can adopt emoji (and any Unicode character)
	- Less fun fact, a process "powered by AI" has 1 of the 5 possible silver level adoption slots for ✨
	- ✨ is being done dirty.
