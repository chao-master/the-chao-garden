When talking about an autism diagnosis I heavily dislike the term "professionally diagnosed" due to the long standing debate about self vs professionally diagnosed autism. To refer to having hence gone and been diagnosed by a professional I use the term "professional's diagnosis"

By the way it costs Â£30 to gain access to an article titled "Which terms should be used to describe autism? Perspectives from the UK autism community" which is the worst thing about the costs of autism I have found out this year.
