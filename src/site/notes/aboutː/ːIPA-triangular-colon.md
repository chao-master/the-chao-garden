This "ː" is an IPA-triangular-colon, it was one of the icons shown to me on Wikipedia when I looked up "colon" to find a visually similar but different character to use in these page titles since Obsidian doesn't allow me to use the regular colon
The other two contenders where:
	- *Smash entry screen* RATIO :
	  Turns out to also not be allowed I think it's just a colon
	- Letter colon ꞉
	  I figured if I was going to I might as well go for a very different character so I didn't get confused later.
