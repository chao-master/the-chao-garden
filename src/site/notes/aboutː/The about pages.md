Hello, welcome to Ripp_'s about pages, hidden deep inside the chao garden. Here I write about random things. If you spot any issues then I left open the [issues... report them there](https://github.com/chao-master/the-chao-garden/issues)

Maybe read: [[aboutː/ːabout-IPA-triangular-colon\|About the about pages]].

The pages are powered by [Digital Garden](http://dg-docs.ole.dev) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)!
If you want to you can find me in the fediverse at [ripp_@chitter.xyz](https://chitter.xyz/users/Ripp_)

I write random things here.

Enjoy them
